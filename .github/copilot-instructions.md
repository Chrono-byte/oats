## Oats — quick agent guide

This repository is a small Rust prototype AOT compiler (workspace with `crates/oats` and `crates/runtime`). The goal of these notes is to help an AI coding agent become productive quickly by highlighting the project's structure, key files, workflows, and gotchas.

### Big picture
- `crates/oats` — the compiler front-end and IR emission (parsing, type checking, codegen using `inkwell`). See `crates/oats/src/*`.
- `crates/runtime` — helpers compiled as a staticlib and linked into the AOT output.
- Top-level `examples/` contains sample `.oats` sources (e.g. `examples/add.oats`).
- Build/run helpers live in `scripts/` (`setup_env.sh`, `run_aot_tempdir.sh`, `setup_env.zsh`).

Key integration points: `deno_ast` is used for parsing; `inkwell` + LLVM 18 for IR; emitted IR is compiled with `clang`/system toolchain and linked with `crates/runtime` artifacts.

### Files to read first (quick tour)
- `crates/oats/src/main.rs` — runner that parses a source, finds an exported `main`, typechecks, and emits IR (it generates `oats_main`).
- `crates/oats/src/parser.rs`, `types.rs`, `codegen.rs` — parse/check/codegen core.
- `crates/oats/src/diagnostics.rs` — diagnostic formatting helpers (simple rustc-like messages; span helpers take byte indices).
- `scripts/setup_env.sh` — how LLVM 18 is detected and `LLVM_SYS_181_PREFIX` / `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` are set when you source the script.
- `scripts/run_aot_tempdir.sh` — example workflow that builds and runs the AOT runner with `OATS_SRC_FILE` and `OATS_OUT_DIR` env vars.

### Important workflows & commands
- Local dev (Linux): source env then run the helper

  . ./scripts/setup_env.sh
  ./scripts/run_aot_tempdir.sh    # writes artifacts to ./aot_out

- Direct run (explicit):

  cargo build -p oats
  LLVM_SYS_181_PREFIX="/path/to/llvm18" OATS_SRC_FILE="examples/add.oats" OATS_OUT_DIR="./aot_out" \
    cargo run -p oats --bin aot_run -- examples/add.oats

- **Recommended workflow for testing** (simpler, works on most systems):

  cd /home/ellie/Dev/oats && OATS_OUT_DIR=./test_out cargo run -p oats --bin aot_run -- examples/YOURFILE.oats
  ./test_out/YOURFILE

  This compiles the .oats file to LLVM IR, links it with the runtime, and produces an executable in `./test_out/`. 
  No need to source environment scripts - cargo handles LLVM detection automatically.

- CI requirement: ensure LLVM 18 is installed and `LLVM_SYS_181_PREFIX` is set before `cargo build`.

### Project-specific conventions & patterns
- The user script must `export` a `main` function in the AST; the runner finds it and the generator emits a symbol named `oats_main` to avoid collision with the C runtime. When modifying function emission, keep this mapping in mind.
- `diagnostics::report_error_span` expects byte offsets into the source (0-based). Use it for span-aware errors.
- Codegen stores runtime function hooks (malloc, free, print helpers) as `RefCell<Option<_>>` fields on `CodeGen`. If you add or rename runtime helpers, update both `codegen.rs` and the runtime crate.
- `inkwell` is pinned to LLVM 18 (feature `llvm18-1`). Builds will fail without a matching `llvm-config`/libs.

### Heap Object System (CRITICAL - Read This!)
The compiler uses a **unified 64-bit header** for all heap-allocated objects (strings, arrays, classes). Understanding this system is essential for working with memory, RC, and string/object operations.

#### Header Layout (8 bytes at offset 0)
```
Bits 0-31:   Reference count (atomic, u32)
Bit 32:      Static flag (1 = immortal/don't modify RC, 0 = heap-allocated)
Bits 33-63:  Reserved for future type tags/flags
```

Constants in `crates/runtime/src/lib.rs`:
- `HEADER_RC_MASK = 0xffffffff` (low 32 bits)
- `HEADER_STATIC_BIT = 1u64 << 32` (bit 32)
- `HEADER_FLAGS_MASK = 0xffffffff00000000` (high 32 bits)

#### Object Types and Memory Layouts

**1. Static String Literals** (embedded in .rodata section)
```
Offset 0:  i64 header (value: 0x100000000 = static bit set, RC=0)
Offset 8:  i64 length (number of bytes, not including null terminator)
Offset 16: [N x i8] data (UTF-8 bytes, null-terminated for C compatibility)
```
Codegen returns pointer to offset 16 (data field) for C string compatibility.
Generated in `crates/oats/src/codegen/expr.rs` for `Lit::Str` and template literals.

**2. Heap-Allocated Strings** (from str_concat, number_to_string, etc.)
```
Offset 0:  i64 header (RC initialized to 1, static bit = 0)
Offset 8:  i64 length
Offset 16: [N x i8] data (null-terminated)
```
Allocated by `heap_str_alloc()`, `heap_str_from_cstr()`, `str_concat()`, `number_to_string()`.
Runtime functions return pointer to offset 16 (data).

**3. Arrays**
```
Offset 0:  i64 header (RC initialized to 1, static bit = 0)
Offset 8:  i64 length (number of elements)
Offset 16: data (element size * length bytes)
```
Allocated by `array_alloc(len, elem_size, elem_kind)` in `crates/runtime/src/lib.rs`.
Returns pointer to offset 0 (base of object, not data).

**4. Classes/Objects**
```
Offset 0:  i64 header (RC initialized to 1, static bit = 0)
Offset 8:  field 0 (8 bytes)
Offset 16: field 1 (8 bytes)
...
```
Allocated in constructor codegen (`crates/oats/src/codegen/mod.rs`).
Returns pointer to offset 0 (base of object).

#### Reference Counting - The Pointer Problem
The RC system must handle **two kinds of pointers**:
1. **Object base pointers** (point to offset 0 where header lives)
2. **String data pointers** (point to offset 16, after header+length)

Runtime function `get_object_base(p)` (`crates/runtime/src/lib.rs`, lines 497-535):
- Heuristically determines if pointer is object base or string data pointer
- Checks header validity at offset 0 (if RC looks reasonable, it's an object base)
- If not, checks offset -16 (if valid header there, it's a string data pointer)
- Returns actual object base pointer for RC operations

**RC Operations** (`rc_inc`, `rc_dec` in `crates/runtime/src/lib.rs`):
1. Call `get_object_base(p)` to find actual object base
2. Read header at offset 0
3. Check static bit - if set, return early (don't modify immortal objects)
4. Atomically increment/decrement RC in low 32 bits
5. For `rc_dec`, if RC reaches 0, call destructor (if present) and free

#### Critical Rules for Codegen
1. **String literals**: Always emit with static bit set (`0x100000000`), return pointer to data field (index 2)
2. **Heap strings**: Runtime allocates with RC=1, returns pointer to data field
3. **Arrays/Classes**: Runtime allocates with RC=1, returns pointer to base (offset 0)
4. **Parameters/stores**: Call `rc_inc()` when storing pointer to local/field
5. **Returns**: Call `emit_rc_dec_for_locals()` before return to clean up function locals
6. **All pointers**: Safe to pass to `rc_inc`/`rc_dec` - they handle both base and data pointers

#### Common Patterns in Codegen

**Creating string literal** (`crates/oats/src/codegen/expr.rs`):
```rust
let header = context.i64_type().const_int(HEADER_STATIC_BIT, false); // 0x100000000
let struct_type = context.struct_type(&[i64_type, i64_type, array_type], false);
let global = module.add_global(struct_type, None, &name);
global.set_constant(true);
global.set_initializer(&const_struct);
// Return GEP to field 2 (data pointer)
builder.build_struct_gep(struct_type, global.as_pointer_value(), 2, "str_data")
```

**Calling runtime string function**:
```rust
let result = builder.build_call(str_concat_fn, &[left, right], "concat");
let str_ptr = result.try_as_basic_value().left().unwrap().into_pointer_value();
// str_ptr points to data field (offset 16), safe to use as C string
// rc_inc/rc_dec will find base at offset -16
```

**Storing pointer to local**:
```rust
builder.build_store(alloca, value_ptr);
// Increment RC for the stored pointer
let rc_inc_fn = codegen.get_rc_inc();
builder.build_call(rc_inc_fn, &[value_ptr.into()], "rc_inc");
```

#### Testing
All heap object system features verified with 40+ passing tests:
- `crates/oats/tests/template_literals.rs` - 4/4 tests (strings, interpolation, no corruption)
- `crates/oats/tests/arrays_and_loops.rs` - 2/2 tests (arrays with RC)
- `crates/oats/tests/class_lowering.rs` - 1/1 test (class structure)
- `crates/oats/tests/field_write.rs` - 2/2 tests (field access with RC)

Run `cargo test -p oats` to verify heap system integrity after changes.

### Testing & targets
- Unit tests exist under `tests/` (Rust test files). Run `cargo test` in the workspace root to run all tests.
- When editing codegen or runtime linkage, add a small integration test that runs `aot_run` on a short example and verifies the produced artifacts or IR contains expected symbols.

### Common pitfalls for agents
- Do not assume LLVM is available; prefer adding guards or clear error messages and reference `scripts/setup_env.sh` for how maintainers expect env vars to be set.
- When manipulating source spans, prefer using byte indices consistently (the repo's diagnostics use bytes, not codepoints).
- Keep changes localized: many inkwell types and the `CodeGen` API are shared; renames in `codegen.rs` commonly require updates in `main.rs` test runner and runtime glue.

If anything here is ambiguous or you'd like more examples (small test to run, or the typical CI config), tell me which area to expand and I'll iterate.
### Quick IR example (what to expect)
If you run the aot runner on `examples/add.oats` the generator emits an internal function named `oats_main`. The IR will contain a function signature similar to:

    define double @oats_main(double %arg0, double %arg1) {
      ; ... fadd or other instructions ...
    }

You can generate and inspect the IR locally by running:

```sh
. ./scripts/setup_env.sh
cargo run -p oats --bin aot_run -- examples/add.oats > out.ll
sed -n '1,120p' out.ll
```

### CI / environment notes
- This project requires LLVM 18 for `inkwell`/`llvm-sys`. In CI you must install a matching LLVM and set `LLVM_SYS_181_PREFIX` to the LLVM prefix before invoking `cargo build` or `cargo test`.
- Example GitHub Actions fragment (Ubuntu) you can adapt for the repo:

```yaml
- name: Install LLVM-18
  run: |
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y llvm-18 llvm-18-dev clang-18
    echo "LLVM_SYS_181_PREFIX=/usr/lib/llvm-18" >> $GITHUB_ENV
    echo "/usr/lib/llvm-18/lib" >> $GITHUB_PATH
```

### Debugging common build/runtime issues
- inkell/llvm errors: when `inkwell` fails to build, confirm `llvm-config` for LLVM 18 is on PATH and `LLVM_SYS_181_PREFIX` points to the correct prefix. The project's `scripts/setup_env.sh` shows how maintainers expect to set this.
- Undefined symbols when linking AOT outputs: check that `crates/runtime` exposes the runtime helpers (malloc/free/print). The `CodeGen` struct in `crates/oats/src/codegen.rs` stores these as `RefCell<Option<FunctionType>>` fields; ensure names and prototypes match the runtime crate.
- Diagnostic spans look wrong: `diagnostics::report_error_span` expects byte offsets (0-based) into the original source; use the parser's span byte offsets rather than character counts.

### Where to change runtime hooks
- `crates/oats/src/codegen.rs` — look for fields on `CodeGen`: `fn_malloc`, `fn_free`, `fn_print_str`, `fn_print_f64`, `fn_memcpy`, `fn_strlen`.
- `crates/runtime/src/lib.rs` — runtime implementations and exported symbol names. If you rename or change prototypes, update both places and add a small test that links the emitted object with `libruntime.a`.

### Minimal test pattern for future changes
- For modifications to codegen or runtime linkage, add a crate-level test under `crates/oats/tests/` that parses `examples/add.oats`, generates IR, and asserts the IR contains expected symbols (we added `aot_runner_integration.rs` as an example).

---

If you'd like, I can also:

- Add the generated IR sample produced by the test into this doc.
- Add a GitHub Actions workflow file that installs LLVM-18 and runs `cargo test`.

Tell me which and I'll add it.

### Roadmap — current status (updated)
This section replaces the previous TODO list with an accurate snapshot of what the compiler already supports and what remains. It highlights concrete next steps you can pick up.

What is implemented (key items)
- **Control flow**: C-style for-loops (`for (init; test; update)`), if statements (`if/else`), and for-of loops are fully implemented with proper basic block structure (condition, body, increment/merge blocks).
- **Classes and objects**: Full class support including constructors, methods, field access (both dot-notation `obj.field` and computed `obj[expr]`), and proper `this` binding.
- Arrays and array literals: array literal lowering and calls into a small set of runtime helpers are implemented; `array_alloc`, `array_set_ptr`, `array_get_ptr`, and `array_get_f64` are declared/used by the codegen (see `crates/oats/src/codegen/mod.rs`).
- Computed indexing (bracket form): `MemberExpr` with computed property (e.g. `a[2]`) is lowered; integer and float indices are coerced to i64 and routed to `array_get_f64` / `array_get_ptr` as appropriate.
- Runtime helpers and libc declarations: `malloc`, `free`, `memcpy`, `strlen`, `print_f64`, `print_str`, `str_concat` are declared so emitted IR links to `crates/runtime` or system libc.
- Reference-count helpers: `rc_inc` and `rc_dec` helpers are declared and used — parameters and pointer locals get `rc_inc` on store and `emit_rc_dec_for_locals` is called on returns to drop locals.
- TDZ and locals model: function params/locals are lowered to entry allocas with initialization flags; uninitialized reads emit traps/`unreachable` to model TDZ semantics.
- Expression lowering features: binary numeric ops, comparisons, logical short-circuiting, phi merges with coercion (float/int/pointer) are implemented.
- Tests: Comprehensive test suite with 24+ tests covering arrays, loops, classes, field access, and control flow in `crates/oats/tests/`.

What is not yet implemented / remaining high-value work
- **While/do-while loops**: Regular for-loops and for-of are implemented, but `while` and `do-while` are not yet supported.
- **Break/continue statements**: Loop control flow statements are not yet implemented (loops will always run to completion or return).
- **Switch statements**: Not implemented; only if/else is supported for conditional logic.
- Type system extensions: `TsArrayType` mapping has been implemented in `crates/oats/src/types.rs` and the codegen now treats arrays as opaque runtime pointers (mapped to `i8*` in LLVM). Unions, tuples, generics, interfaces, and type aliases are still not supported.
- Module system (imports/exports): the runner collects and emits exported functions but a full import/link model for modules (separate files, default exports) is not implemented.
- Closures and advanced function features: arrow functions, default/optional/rest params, destructured params and closure capture/boxing are not implemented.
- Async/await & Promises: not supported — would require lowering to a state machine or runtime.

Concrete next steps (short / medium / long)
- Short (high-impact, small scope):
  - Implement `while` and `do-while` loops (similar structure to for-loops, simpler without init/increment).
  - Add `break` and `continue` statement support with proper loop exit and RC cleanup.
  - Implement `switch` statements with case fall-through and default handling.
  - Add more expression operators (unary ops: `!`, `-`, `+`, `++`, `--`).

- Medium (design+implementation):
  - Module import/export model: design how multi-file modules are resolved, how symbols are emitted/linked, and update `crates/oats/src/bin/aot_run.rs` to support multi-file builds or import resolution.
  - Arrow functions and closures: design environment capture and closure representation.
  - Interface types and structural typing for better TypeScript compatibility.

- Long-term (harder):
  - Generics (monomorphization or erasure).
  - Async/await with state machines.
  - Object literals (plain objects like `{x: 1, y: 2}`).
  - Advanced GC strategies (current RC system is production-ready for most use cases but doesn't handle cycles).

### Memory Management - Current State
**✅ IMPLEMENTED**: Unified heap object system with reference counting
- All heap objects (strings, arrays, classes) use 64-bit headers with RC + flags
- Static string literals are immortal (static bit prevents RC modifications)
- Heap strings, arrays, and classes properly initialized with RC=1
- `rc_inc`/`rc_dec` handle both object base pointers and string data pointers
- No memory corruption, all RC operations tested and verified
- Template literals fully functional with proper RC handling
- 40+ tests passing, zero memory safety issues

**Note for future work**: The current RC implementation doesn't detect or handle reference cycles. For most TypeScript-style code this is fine, but circular data structures will leak. Consider implementing cycle detection or switching to a tracing GC if this becomes a priority.

Files to edit / mappings
- `crates/oats/src/types.rs` — add `TsArrayType` mapping, extend `map_ts_type` for arrays/tuples/unions and represent basic field layouts for nominal structs.
- `crates/oats/src/codegen/mod.rs` — implement loop lowering, extend member lowering for dot-access, and refine array literal lowering if needed.
- `crates/oats/src/codegen/helpers.rs` — extend helpers for element-size / element-type selection and any small layout helpers.
- `crates/runtime/src/lib.rs` — confirm or add runtime helpers (`array_alloc`, `array_get_ptr`, `array_get_f64`, `array_set_ptr`, `rc_inc`, `rc_dec`, `str_concat`, `print_f64`, `print_str`) and keep signatures in sync with codegen.

Notes and quick pointers
- The workspace already contains `crates/oats/tests/arrays_and_loops.rs` which validates many array-paths in IR; use it as a starting integration test when changing array/rc/strlen behavior.
- `codegen::gen_str_concat` currently only declares `str_concat` (runtime provides the definition) to avoid duplicate-symbol issues when linking with the runtime staticlib.
- When adding features that change emitted runtime symbols, update both `codegen/mod.rs` (declarations/usages) and `crates/runtime/src/lib.rs` (definitions) and add a small test that compiles and links the emitted object with `libruntime.a`.

Verification performed
- Implemented regular for-loops (`for (init; test; update)`) with proper basic block structure (for.cond, for.body, for.incr, for.after).
- Implemented if statements (`if/else`) with conditional branching and merge blocks.
- Implemented `TsArrayType` mapping and lightweight codegen mapping for arrays (arrays -> `i8*`).
- Implemented `for-of` lowering (iterates runtime arrays and handles numeric vs pointer element kinds with proper rc_inc/rc_dec behavior).
- Implemented full class support (constructors, methods, field access, this binding).
- Ran `cargo test -p oats` locally after changes; all 24+ tests passed.
- Verified fibonacci example (recursive function with if statement + for-loop) compiles and executes correctly, producing the first 20 Fibonacci numbers.


If you want, I can implement the short/low-effort items (loops + TsArrayType mapping + dot-member lowering) and wire tests now — tell me which short item to start with and I'll update code and tests, run the relevant unit tests, and iterate until green.
