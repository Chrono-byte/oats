> An Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compiler for TypeScript

Oats is an experimental Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compiler that transforms a strict
subset of TypeScript into native machine code. It leverages the power of LLVM to
produce fast, standalone executables with deterministic memory management via
reference counting.

## ‚ú® Features

Oats is a work in progress, but it already supports a solid set of modern
language features:

- **Type System**: `number`, `boolean`, `string`, `void`, and typed arrays
  (`number[]`, `string[]`)
- **Classes**: Full support for class declarations with constructors, methods,
  fields, and `this` binding
- **Control Flow**: `if`/`else`, `for` loops, `while` loops, `do-while` loops,
  and `for-of` loops
- **Operators**: Full support for binary and unary operators
- **Memory Management**: A robust, automatic reference counting (RC) system for
  all heap-allocated objects (strings, arrays, classes), ensuring deterministic
  memory cleanup
- **Toolchain**: A complete build driver that compiles Oats code into a
  standalone native executable

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Rust Toolchain**: Install Rust via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)
- **LLVM 18**: Oats requires LLVM version 18

### Installing LLVM 18

#### Ubuntu / Debian:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y llvm-18-dev clang-18
```
#### Fedora:

```bash
sudo dnf install llvm18 llvm18-devel clang18
```

### Compiling Your First Program

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Chrono-byte/oats.git
   cd oats
   ```

2. **Write Your Oats Program:**

   Create a file named `hello.oats`:
   ```typescript
   // hello.oats
   export function main(): void {
       println("Hello from Oats! üåæ");
   }
   ```

3. **Compile and Run:**

   Use the `aot_run` binary to compile your program into a native executable.
   This single command handles everything: compiling your Oats code, building
   the runtime, and linking the final binary.

   ```bash
   # This will create an executable at ./aot_out/hello
   cargo run -p oats --bin aot_run -- ./hello.oats

   # Run your compiled program!
   ./aot_out/hello
   ```

   You should see `Hello from Oats! üåæ` printed to your console.

## üìÅ Project Structure

The Oats compiler is organized as a Rust workspace with two main crates:

- **`crates/oats`**: The core compiler, responsible for parsing, type checking,
  and generating LLVM IR from Oats source code
- **`crates/runtime`**: A small, C-callable runtime library written in Rust. It
  provides essential services like memory allocation, reference counting, and
  helpers for string and array manipulation

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Oats is an ambitious project with a lot of exciting
work ahead. The best place to start is by reading through the extensive internal
documentation in the `docs/` directory, especially:

- **`docs/ROADMAP_TO_REAL_TYPESCRIPT.md`**: The long-term vision and feature
  plan
- **`docs/IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md`**: A list of immediate technical debt and
  refactoring opportunities

### Development Workflow

1. **Set up your environment**: The `scripts/setup_env.sh` script can help
   configure your shell with the necessary environment variables for LLVM.
   ```bash
   source ./scripts/setup_env.sh
   ```

2. **Build and test**:
   ```bash
   cargo build
   cargo test --workspace
   ```
