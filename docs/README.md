# Oats Documentation Guide

**Last Updated:** October 10, 2025

Welcome to the Oats compiler documentation! This guide helps you navigate the documentation and find what you need.

## Quick Start

**New to Oats?** Start here:
1. Read the main `README.md` in the repository root
2. Follow setup instructions in `DEVELOPMENT.md`
3. Try running examples from `examples/`
4. Read `ARCHITECTURE.md` for system overview

**Want to contribute?** Read:
1. `CONTRIBUTING.md` (in repository root) - Contribution guidelines
2. `DEVELOPMENT.md` - Development workflows and standards
3. `ROADMAP.md` - Current priorities and future plans

## Documentation Structure

### Core Documentation

#### [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) ‚≠ê START HERE for technical understanding
**Purpose:** Authoritative reference for runtime memory model and compiler contracts  
**Audience:** All contributors  
**Content:**
- Heap object layout (header, meta-slot, data)
- Reference counting rules and contracts
- Pointer types and canonicalization
- Codegen requirements and checklist

**When to read:** Before making changes to object layout, RC behavior, or core codegen.

#### [`DEVELOPMENT.md`](DEVELOPMENT.md) ‚≠ê START HERE for contributing
**Purpose:** Practical development guide  
**Audience:** Contributors at all levels  
**Content:**
- Environment setup
- Coding standards and error handling patterns
- Testing strategies (unit, snapshot, integration)
- Common development tasks (adding runtime functions, types, expressions)
- Debugging guide
- Pre-commit checklist

**When to read:** Before starting any development work.

#### [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) ‚≠ê START HERE for project direction
**Purpose:** Project roadmap and current priorities  
**Audience:** Contributors, users, project planners  
**Content:**
- Current implementation status (what's done, what's not)
- Development phases (Stability, Async, Language Features, Cycles)
- Timeline estimates
- Current work items (pick one to implement!)
- Decision log

**When to read:** To understand project priorities and find contribution opportunities.

### Specialized Documentation

#### Async/Await Implementation

Three documents covering async/await at different levels of detail:

**[`ASYNC_AWAIT.md`](ASYNC_AWAIT.md)** - Overview and Status  
- High-level design and architecture
- Current implementation status (Phase 0 complete, Phase 1 40%)
- Examples and usage
- **Read this first** if you're working on async features

**[`ASYNC_PHASE1.md`](ASYNC_PHASE1.md)** - State Machine Design  
- Detailed state machine transformation plan
- Executor and waker design
- Implementation steps (A, B, C, D)
- Edge cases and considerations
- **Read this** if implementing state machine generation

**[`ASYNC_PRIMITIVES.md`](ASYNC_PRIMITIVES.md)** - Runtime Specification  
- Complete ABI and object layout specs
- Runtime primitive signatures
- Codegen contracts
- Memory management rules for async
- **Read this** when implementing runtime async helpers

**Relationship:** `ASYNC_AWAIT.md` (overview) ‚Üí `ASYNC_PHASE1.md` (compiler) ‚Üí `ASYNC_PRIMITIVES.md` (runtime)

#### Memory Management

**[`CCRC.md`](CCRC.md)** - Cycle Collecting Reference Counting  
- Design for automatic cycle detection
- Weak reference support
- Trial-deletion algorithm
- Implementation milestones
- **Status:** Design complete, implementation planned for Phase 4

## Documentation by Use Case

### "I want to add a new language feature"

1. Read `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Understand object model
2. Read `DEVELOPMENT.md` - "Adding a New Expression Type" or "Adding a New Type"
3. Read `ROADMAP.md` - Check if feature is planned, what phase
4. Write tests first (TDD approach)
5. Implement feature following error handling patterns
6. Update docs if needed

### "I want to fix a bug"

1. Read relevant section of `ARCHITECTURE.md` or `DEVELOPMENT.md`
2. Write a failing test that reproduces the bug
3. Fix the bug
4. Verify test passes and no regressions
5. Update docs if bug revealed incorrect documentation

### "I want to understand async/await"

1. Read `ASYNC_AWAIT.md` - Overview and current status
2. Look at `examples/proper_tests/async_await.oats` - Working example
3. Read `ASYNC_PHASE1.md` if diving deeper into state machines
4. Read `ASYNC_PRIMITIVES.md` for runtime implementation details

### "I want to improve performance"

1. Read `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Memory layout costs
2. Read `DEVELOPMENT.md` - "Performance Considerations"
3. Profile first (`cargo build --timings`, `perf`, `valgrind`)
4. Identify bottleneck
5. Optimize with tests to prevent regressions

### "I want to add a runtime function"

1. Read `DEVELOPMENT.md` - "Adding a New Runtime Function"
2. Add to `crates/runtime/src/lib.rs` with `#[no_mangle]`
3. Declare in `crates/oats/src/codegen/mod.rs`
4. Add tests in `crates/runtime/tests/`
5. Document the function purpose and contracts

## Documentation Maintenance

### Keeping Docs Current

**When to update docs:**
- Adding or changing features ‚Üí Update ROADMAP.md, relevant design docs
- Changing object layout or RC rules ‚Üí Update ARCHITECTURE.md
- Adding runtime functions or ABIs ‚Üí Update relevant design docs
- Completing a phase ‚Üí Update ROADMAP.md status
- Discovering incorrect documentation ‚Üí Fix immediately

**How to update:**
- Make doc changes in the same PR as code changes
- Explain doc changes in PR description
- Keep docs concise and authoritative
- Add "Last Updated" dates when making significant changes

### Doc Review Checklist

Before merging changes:
- [ ] All affected docs updated
- [ ] No contradictions between docs
- [ ] Examples still work
- [ ] Status headers current
- [ ] Cross-references valid
