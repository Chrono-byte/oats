Of course. Based on the provided compiler documentation and source code, here is a to-do list for the Oats compiler, organized from easiest to most difficult to implement.

### Short-Term (Easiest)

These tasks are well-defined, build directly upon existing infrastructure, and represent the next logical steps.

* **Enhance Diagnostic Messages**
    * **Description**: Improve the user-friendliness of error messages. While a good foundation exists in `diagnostics.rs`, the messages for common errors like missing semicolons or type mismatches could provide more context and better suggestions.
    * **Justification**: This is a high-impact, low-effort task that significantly improves the developer experience. It primarily involves editing the `diagnostics.rs` file.

* **Add More Granular Tests for Existing Features**
    * **Description**: Write more focused unit tests for features that are already implemented, such as `for`/`while` loops, `break`/`continue` statements, and the `for-of` loop's use of array helpers.
    * **Justification**: The testing framework is already in place. Adding more tests is a straightforward way to increase code quality and prevent regressions.

* **Implement Dot-Member Access for Nominal Structs**
    * **Description**: Implement the lowering for direct member access (e.g., `obj.field`). This would involve mapping field names to offsets within the struct and generating the necessary LLVM IR to load the value.
    * **Justification**: The compiler already has support for `OatsType::NominalStruct` and computed member access (`obj[index]`), making this a natural and relatively simple extension.

### Medium-Term (Moderately Difficult)

These tasks require more design and implementation effort, likely touching multiple parts of the compiler.

* **Expand the Type System**
    * **Description**: Add support for more advanced types like unions, tuples, and generics. This would involve extending the `OatsType` enum in `types.rs` and adding the corresponding logic to the type checker and code generator.
    * **Justification**: This is a significant undertaking but is essential for making the language more expressive and useful. The design doc outlines a clear path for this.

* **Basic Class Implementation**
    * **Description**: Implement the lowering for `class` declarations, including constructors and methods. This would involve mapping class declarations to the existing `NominalStruct` representation and emitting functions for constructors and methods.
    * **Justification**: This is a major feature, but the groundwork has already been laid with the `NominalStruct` type and the existing function generation infrastructure.

* **Implement a Module System**
    * **Description**: Design and implement a system for multi-file modules, including resolving imports and linking symbols. This would be a major update to the `aot_run.rs` binary and would require a well-defined strategy for symbol management.
    * **Justification**: This is a critical feature for writing larger, more organized programs. The `copilot-instructions.md` file identifies this as a medium-difficulty task.

### Long-Term (Most Difficult)

These are large, complex features that would require significant design, implementation, and testing effort.

* **Implement Closures and Advanced Function Features**
    * **Description**: Add support for arrow functions, default/optional/rest parameters, and closure capture. This is a complex task that would require significant changes to the code generator to handle environment capturing and boxing.
    * **Justification**: This would bring the language much closer to modern TypeScript/JavaScript, but the implementation details are non-trivial.

* **Implement a More Advanced Memory Management System**
    * **Description**: Replace the current reference counting system with a more advanced memory management system, such as a tracing garbage collector.
    * **Justification**: While the current reference counting system is adequate for a prototype, a more robust solution would be needed for a production-ready language to handle cycles and improve performance.

* **Implement Async/Await and Promises**
    * **Description**: Add support for asynchronous programming with `async`/`await` and Promises. This would require a major effort to implement a runtime with an event loop and to lower `async` functions to state machines.
    * **Justification**: This is a hallmark of modern systems programming languages, but it is also one of the most complex features to implement correctly.
