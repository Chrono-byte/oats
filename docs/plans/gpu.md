Automatic GPU Offloading: A Strategy for Oats

The goal is to implement a system where the Oats compiler can automatically identify and offload computationally intensive code to the GPU without requiring any special syntax or developer intervention. This document outlines the required compiler components, the key design challenges, and a proposed staged approach to implementation.
1. Core Compiler Components for Automatic Offloading

To achieve this, the compiler needs to become significantly more sophisticated. It will require several new analysis and transformation passes:

    Parallelism Analyzer: This component is responsible for analyzing the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to find code regions—primarily loops—that are "data-parallel." It must prove that each iteration of the loop is independent and can be executed safely on a separate GPU thread.

    Data Dependency Analyzer: Once a parallel region is identified, this component must determine the complete set of data required for the computation. It needs to track which variables are read-only (inputs), which are write-only (outputs), and which are read-write. This is critical for managing memory transfers.

    Profitability Heuristic (Cost Model): Not every parallel loop is worth offloading. The overhead of transferring data to and from the GPU can easily outweigh the computational speedup, especially for small datasets or short-running tasks. The compiler needs a model to estimate the cost of data transfer vs. the potential gain from GPU execution to make an informed decision.

    Code Transformer: This is the implementation engine. It takes the identified code region and:

        Generates a new GPU kernel function from the body of the loop.

        Injects runtime calls before the region to allocate GPU memory and copy the necessary input data from the CPU (host) to the GPU (device).

        Replaces the original loop with a call to the runtime to launch the generated kernel on the GPU.

        Injects runtime calls after the region to copy the results back from the device to the host.

2. New Design Questions for an Automatic System

This implicit model fundamentally changes our design questions. The focus shifts from "how does the user express X?" to "how does the compiler deduce X?".

    Code Identification:

        How will the compiler reliably identify GPU-candidate code? Will it rely on static pattern matching (e.g., simple for loops over arrays), or will it require more advanced techniques like polyhedral analysis?

        How will it handle complex cases like nested loops, conditional branches within loops, or function calls within loops?

    Data Management:

        How will the compiler manage the lifecycle of GPU memory implicitly? How does it know when data on the GPU is no longer needed and can be freed?

        What is the strategy for minimizing data transfers? For example, if two consecutive loops use the same data, can the compiler keep the data on the GPU between the calls?

        How can the compiler identify opportunities for preloading data? This involves initiating asynchronous memory transfers ahead of time to hide latency and requires advanced inter-procedural data flow analysis.

    Profitability and Performance:

        How do we build a robust cost model? Should it be based on static heuristics (e.g., "offload if the loop iterates more than 1024 times"), or will it require profile-guided optimization (PGO), where data from previous runs informs future compilation?

        How do we handle performance predictability? If minor, unrelated code changes cause the compiler's heuristics to change and dramatically alter performance, it can make debugging and optimization very difficult for the user.

    Transparency and Debugging:

        This is the biggest challenge of the automatic approach. If the compiler transparently rewrites code, how does a developer debug it? How do they know why their code is suddenly slow (because the compiler decided not to offload it) or fast?

        Should there be a mechanism for the developer to inspect the compiler's decisions? For example, a compiler flag (--dump-gpu-plan) that explains what it offloaded and why?

        Should there be an "escape hatch" to allow the developer to override the compiler's decision, perhaps with a simple annotation like @never_gpu or @force_gpu?

3. Proposed Staged Implementation

A fully automatic system is incredibly complex. A pragmatic approach would be to implement it in stages, gradually increasing the level of automation.

    Stage 1: Pragma/Annotation-Directed Offloading (Semi-Automatic).

        Introduce a simple annotation (e.g., @gpu) that a developer can place on a for loop.

        This annotation is a promise to the compiler: "This loop is safe to parallelize and is worth offloading."

        This removes the need for the compiler to perform its own parallelism and profitability analysis, allowing the team to focus solely on the Code Transformer and runtime, which is still a massive task.

    Stage 2: Heuristic-Based Automatic Offloading.

        Once the transformation pipeline is solid, build a conservative static analyzer that automatically identifies only the most obvious and guaranteed-to-be-profitable patterns (e.g., simple vector addition on large arrays).

        The @gpu annotation from Stage 1 would still be available for more complex cases.

    Stage 3: Advanced, Cost-Model-Based Offloading.

        This is the final vision. With a mature compiler and runtime, develop a sophisticated cost model (potentially using PGO) to make more aggressive and dynamic decisions about what to offload.

This staged approach allows for incremental progress and provides a functional, useful system to developers at each stage while building towards the ultimate goal of a fully transparent GPU acceleration system.
